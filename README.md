## Overview

- **Modern features brought to IRC.** Push notifications, link previews, new message markers, and more bring IRC to the 21st century.
- **Always connected.** Remains connected to IRC servers while you are offline.
- **Cross platform.** It doesn't matter what OS you use, it just works wherever Node.js runs.
- **Responsive interface.** The client works smoothly on every desktop, smartphone and tablet.
- **Synchronized experience.** Always resume where you left off no matter what device.

As this is not the official client all configurations, setup etc may be a bit different than the original clients. At the current
stage this isn't as big of a deal. But just keep it in mind when using the original clients documentations.

To learn more about configuration, usage and features of The Lounge, take a look at [the website](https://thelounge.chat).

"The Lounge with blackjack and hookers" is fork of [The Lounge](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/) which is the official and
community-managed fork of [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout), by [Mattias Erming](https://github.com/erming).

|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|
| Rolling releases                | Instead of waiting for aeons on new releases to add features, the main feature of this version is continuous updates.<br>I will set up a proper Docker workflow to generate new images for you to use. Maybe I'll look into a "one-click to update" feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | High     | üü°      |
| Jump to searchresult / mentions | One of the main downsides of the original client is that you are not able to jump to your mentions nor to search results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | High     | ‚ö™      |
| PostgreSQL backend              | Instead of using SQLite or text file-based logs I want PostgreSQL support. Which should be faster and be able to handle<br>much more logs/data. [PostgreSQL Website](https://www.postgresql.org/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Medium   | ‚ö™      |
| Animated WEBP support           | Animated WEBP are basically GIFs but way more space efficient. Thus you can have looping HD reaction images which only use a few kilobytes.<br>Currently, they are not supported at all. (This was already developed for the official client but it was removed again).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | High     | üü£      |
| Auto image compression          | Enable automatic image compression (either jpg or webp). This helps to reduce bandwidth makes image previews snappier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Low      | ‚ö™      |
| Link preview before sending     | Link preview of the links yet to be sent so you won't accidentally send that embarrassing photo of yours. (Like any other<br>reasonable modern message client)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Medium   | üü£      |
| Telegram like sticker support   | I hate searching for reactions to messages in my folders and sending them when it's already too late. Instead I want to<br>add Telegram stickers support. How this will look like is not yet defined but I do want to be able to convert actual<br>Telegram sticker packs to packs usable for you in this client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Low      | ‚ö™      |
| Bits and pieces                 | - Changing network settings does not reconnect you (eg. when you want to enable a proxy)<br>- Right-clicking networks is not possible anymore in the latest release preview<br>- `/quit` instantly removes a network without warning (incl. all settings)<br>- Topic box on mobile is not userfriendly<br>- Disconnected networks show the disconnected icon next to the name which can't be clicked to reconnect<br>	You either have to go to the network, hit the three-dot menu and hit connect or write out `/connect` and hit enter. | -        | -      |
