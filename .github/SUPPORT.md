## Support

Welcome to The Lounge with blackjack and hookers, it's great to have you here!

Note: This is not the official "The Lounge", but a fork that aims to release
features faster at the cost of maybe not being as fleshed from the get go.

If you have a question, or need help, you have a few options:

- You can always [create an Issue](https://github.com/Nachtalb/thelounge/issues/new)
  here on Github,
- send me a message on [Libera.chat](https://libera.chat) at `Nachtalb`
- or send me an email `na@nachtalb.io`
